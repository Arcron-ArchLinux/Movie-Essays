Kevin’s mother was very angry and dragged him upstairs into the attic
Kevin said he wished his family would disappear so his mother, Kate said that he reconsider his thought that they maybe forget him at home and left him.
and went down to drink some beer actually they had a flight to France next morning.
Buzz, Rod and Kevin look out the window there was a man who was bald and had salt in a barrel and was removing the ice from the road with salt,
Buzz told them that the man who had the barrel was a serial killer and that he had murdered his entire family
then Rod asked him that where did he hide his bodies to which Buzz said inside the barrels he used to pour salt on the bodies in the barrel so they would decompose
without leaving a trace. Anyway in the morning Kevin wakes up and goes downstairs no one was there in the house each room he checked but no one.
He was very happy that everyone had gone first he started his day with taking a bath and then eating some of his weird food combinations
