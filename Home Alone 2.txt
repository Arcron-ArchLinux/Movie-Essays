In Home Alone 2: Lost In New York.
Just as usual it is christmas and Uncle Frank has come and in the Christmas Pageant Kevin, Buzz and all their cousins are also in the pageant when it is Kevin's turn to sing he starts
singing beautifully but Buzz is jealous and takes the candles and pretends drumming Kevin's head and making funny things on top of his head and everyone starts laughing Kevin was 
confused and startled he looked behind him where Buzz suddenly takes his candles back and pretends that nothing had happened but Kevin knew he punched Buzz real hard and he fell on his
back and everyone started to get toppled over each other at home Buzz makes a formal forgiveness speech at the end everyone applauds for him then it was Kevin's turn but he said he will
not ask forgiveness for what Buzz had done then Kate, his mother tells him that she was going to make him sleep on the third floor with fuller then Kevin shouts, "THAT IS WHAT I GET 
EVERYTIME AND I DO NOT CARE ABOUT BUZZ!" and he stormed out of the room and ran up to the third floor and flopps down on Fuller's bed then a few minutes later his mom comes and she said
that he should come down and give a forgiveness speech but Kevin says that if he had his own money he would go on a vacation alone somewhere else without anyone else so his mom told him 
that he should sit there and think abut giving a forgiveness speech but Kevin says that he'd rather kiss a toilet seat that make a forgiveness speech for Buzz.

The next morning everyone wakes up late and the whole house emerged into chaos because they had to leave for Florida for christmas they all hurriedly dress themselves including Kevin he 
also woke up on time and was already in the van when everyone else settled in Kevin's mom counts the tickets 7 for Uncle Frank's family and 7 for Kate's family then when Kate starts 
counting she distributes all but Kevin's she cannot find him she shouts, "KEVIN!" then Kevin replies, "Yes I am in the van" and he took the ticket when they are at the airport Kevin had
a recorder whose battery needed to be replaced so he asked his dad he told him that he would give him the batteries on the plane but Kevin is restless he starts rummaging in his dad's 
bag and his dad starts running towards the terminal so he also rummaging and running at the same time he followed his dad but in the way he stopped to search for the batteries but his 
dad had worn a brown coat and red scarf but there was another man with the same coat but Kevin thought he was his dad and followed him on the flight to New York which he did not know and
gets seated on the plane when they reached New York, Kevin starts looking for his family then he saw the towers from the 9/11 attack then he asked the flight-person that where was he and
they told him that he was in New York. Suddenly he sees a newspaper with the headlines, "THE WET BANDITS ESCAPE FROM PRISON DURING WILD RIOT IN POLICE STATION" he started to worry.

what I liked about this story was that Kevin is very intelligent and fools those two Wet Bandits and tricks them into handing them over to the cops. A very funny story.
